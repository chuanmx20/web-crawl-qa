      "   - If the file has already been saved to a location or you are using the desktop version, clicking <Save> will save the updates to the current file.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "5. When saving to your device for the first time, you will be given the option to choose the file format (e.g., .drawio, .xml, etc.) and name the file. Select the desired options and click <Save> in the dialog box that appears.\n",
