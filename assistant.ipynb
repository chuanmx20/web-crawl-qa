      "\n",
      "3. **Saving to Different Locations**:\n",
      "   - If you want to save the diagram to a specific location or service, you will see options like <Save As> or <Save to Cloud>. Choose the appropriate option based on where you wish to save your diagram. You may be given choices such as saving to your computer, Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox, GitHub, or other integrated cloud services.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Name the File (First Save or Save As)**:\n",
      "   - If this is the first time you are saving the diagram or you are using the \"Save As\" feature, a dialog box will appear prompting you to name your file and choose a location to save it. Enter the file name and select the desired location.\n",

      "1. **Select Shapes**:\n",
      "   - Click on the shapes you want to align while holding the `Shift` key to select multiple shapes.\n",

      "2. **Choose Alignment Option**:\n",
      "   - Once your shapes are selected, go to the format toolbar located at the top of the canvas.\n",
      "   - Locate the alignment options in the toolbar. These are typically represented by icons showing lines aligned to the left, center, or right, and top, middle, or bottom.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Apply Alignment**:\n",
      "   - Click on the desired alignment button to align the shapes accordingly.\n",
      "      - **Left Align**: Aligns the left edges of the selected shapes.\n",
      "      - **Center Align**: Aligns the centers of the selected shapes horizontally.\n",
      "      - **Right Align**: Aligns the right edges of the selected shapes.\n",
      "      - **Top Align**: Aligns the top edges of the selected shapes.\n",
      "      - **Middle Align**: Aligns the centers of the selected shapes vertically.\n",
      "      - **Bottom Align**: Aligns the bottom edges of the selected shapes.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Use Arrange Menu (Alternative Method)**:\n",
      "   - Alternatively, you can use the <Arrange> menu for more alignment options.\n",
      "   - With shapes selected, click on the <Arrange> menu at the top.\n",
      "   - Hover over the <Align> submenu to see the same list of alignment options.\n",
      "   - Click on the alignment you want to apply.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Adjust Spacing (Optional)**:\n",
      "   - If you want to distribute the shapes evenly, you can use the distribute options located near the alignment tools in the format toolbar or under the <Arrange> menu in the <Distribute> submenu.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember that the alignment will be based on the bounding boxes of the selected shapes. It's important to select all the shapes you want to align before using these alignment tools. If you only select one shape, these tools will not have any visible effect, as there's nothing to align that single shape with.\n",
